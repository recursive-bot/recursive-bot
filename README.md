I am a recent graduate from PES University with a B.Tech in Electronics and Communication Engineering, driven by a profound interest in technology and a dedication to solving complex problems.

During my academic journey, I discovered a strong passion for cybersecurity and actively pursued it through self-learning, solving Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges, and hands-on practice. My commitment to continuous growth has earned me the EC-Council Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH v13) certifications — Theory, Practical, and Master’s.

I’m enthusiastic about applying my skills in ethical hacking, penetration testing, and security analysis to contribute to real-world cybersecurity challenges. My goal is to build impactful solutions that enhance digital safety while continuously expanding my expertise

## Objective

My journey in Electronics and Communication has cultivated a strong passion for cybersecurity, driving me to develop expertise in both defensive SOC operations and offensive security practices. I am now eager to transition into the field by contributing as a Tier 1 SOC Analyst or Penetration Tester, where I can apply my skills in threat detection, incident response, and vulnerability assessment while continuously growing to address evolving cyber threats.
